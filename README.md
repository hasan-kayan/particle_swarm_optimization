Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, a population-based stochastic optimization technique. PSO is inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling, where individuals (particles) move through a search space to find the optimal solution by learning from their own experience and the experiences of their neighbors.

Overview
The PSO algorithm is widely used in various optimization problems, including but not limited to, function optimization, neural network training, and feature selection. This implementation provides a generic framework for solving optimization problems using PSO.

Features
Implementation of the standard PSO algorithm.
Customizable parameters such as population size, maximum iterations, inertia weight, cognitive and social coefficients.
Support for both continuous and discrete optimization problems.
Easily extensible for different objective functions and constraints.
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/particle_swarm_optimization.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd particle_swarm_optimization

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start using the PSO algorithm for your optimization problem by modifying the provided template files.

Usage
Define Objective Function: Implement your objective function in the objective_function.py file. This function should take a solution candidate as input and return a scalar value representing its fitness or objective value.

Configure PSO Parameters: Adjust the PSO parameters such as population size, maximum iterations, inertia weight, cognitive and social coefficients in the pso_config.py file.

Run PSO Algorithm: Execute the main.py script to run the PSO algorithm on your defined objective function:
