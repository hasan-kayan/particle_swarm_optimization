# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, a population-based stochastic optimization technique. PSO is inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling, where individuals (particles) move through a search space to find the optimal solution by learning from their own experience and the experiences of their neighbors.

## Overview
The PSO algorithm is widely used in various optimization problems, including but not limited to, function optimization, neural network training, and feature selection. This implementation provides a generic system for solving optimization problems using PSO. In this project I have created a basic system that accepts example data to process in PSO algorithm and generates the project folder which contains the results of the PSO and its visualaziotions. 

## Setup The Program  

- First you need to clone this repostory --> $ git clone https://github.com/hasan-kayan/particle_swarm_optimization 
- Go to the path and run this script --> $ pip install -r requirements.txt 
- Now you are ready to run but hovever you can also use directly to venv by --> $Â source/bin/venv/activate
- Then run the code -->  $ python3 main.py

## Usage 
- When program starts it will ask you to choose a project directory than at the choosen directory you need to give a name to your project and let it create a new directory at the choosen one, enter the name of the project by terminal. 
- Than you need to choose a csv file from your computer as your example data. 
- Enter the iteration number of the program which will determine how many data you want to generate.

  Let program run and now you can see the results at project directory.


## Contributing
Contributions to improve this PSO implementation are welcome! Here are a few ways you can contribute:

Implement additional variations of the PSO algorithm.
Improve performance and efficiency of the existing implementation.
Provide examples and use cases demonstrating the application of PSO to various optimization problems.
Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for more details on how to contribute.
